In this project, I recognize the speech of the user and print it on the Tkinter window and convert the text typed by the user to speech.

For this project I utilized libraries and tools:
a) SpeechRecognition: for recognizing the speech and to convert it into text
format using Googleâ€™s Web Speech API.
b) PyAudio: for accessing and working with the Microphone.
c) pyttsx3: for converting given text to speech (ie for generating computer
voice.
d) SQLite: for saving files in a database.
e) Tkinter: for creating the GUI.
